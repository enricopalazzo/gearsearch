    "body": "Per Gessle\nThe Fender Telecaster, colloquially known as the Tele /?t?li/, is the world's first commercially successful solid-body electric guitar. Its simple yet effective design and revolutionary sound broke ground and set trends in electric guitar manufacturing and popular music. Introduced for national distribution as the Broadcaster in the autumn of 1950, it was the first guitar of its kind manufactured on a substantial scale and has been in continuous production in one form or another since its first incarnation.\nGarth Brooks\nThis photo was taken during his tour with Trisha Yearwood. He is seen playing this Fender Telecaster, which is very weird in its appearance. It has 2 P90 pickups and a bridge which is rather unusal for Telecasters. This might also be the Warmoth Partscaster, considering I found pretty close models to this one being a Warmoth, but on this one it says Fender, so I'm just going to go with Fender...\nBrian James\n\"As for the Telecaster, well, a Gibson always sounds like a Gibson, and a Strat, however you set it up, you eventually start playing Hendrix stuff, but, for me, a Telecaster is an anonymous guitar, which relies on what amp you use. Ive managed to get a sound which is fairly unique to me, I think. My main Telecaster has a Fender body and a Squier neck, cause I smashed the neck on tour with The Lords, and my guitar roadie could only find a Squier neck. I found that I had an extra three frets or so to play with, its thinner, so its been on there ever since.\"",

    "body": "Guitars & Guitarists\nDevo have always taken an unconventional approach to their music, videos, and striking fashion sense so its no surprise that this attitude would also apply to their choice of guitars. While many think of them as a synthpop band with the occasional guitar thrown in, in their early years they were precisely the opposite  at times featuring three guitarists in their line up (guitarist Bob1 [Mothersbaugh], guitarist/keyboardist Bob2 [Casale], and singer/keyboardist/guitarist Mark Mothersbaugh). By the early 80s, however, Bob1 was the only member with strings on his instrument with Bob2 and bassist Jerry Casale having mostly switched over to playing their parts on synths. They seemed to have not only enjoyed unusual choices in guitars (shying away from the all too common Strats and Les Pauls) but rotating through many different models as well.",

Megan Thee Stallion\n\n[Verse 1: Adam Levine]\nIt's beautiful, it's bittersweet\nYou're like a broken home to me\nI take a shot of memories\nAnd black out like an empty street\nI fill my days with the way you walk\nAnd fill my nights with broken dreams\nI make up lies inside my head\nLike one day you'll come back to me\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]\nNow I'm not holding on, not holding on\nI'm just depressed that you're gone\nNot holding on, not holding on\n\n[Chorus: Adam Levine]\nBeautiful mistakes\nI make inside my head, she's naked in my bed\nAnd now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes\nI wouldn't take 'еm back, I'm in love with the past\nAnd now we liе awake, makin' beautiful mistakes\n\n[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]\nNah-nah-nah, in my head\nNah-nah-nah, in my bed\nNah-nah-nah, eh\nMakin' beautiful mistakes\n\n[Verse 2: Adam Levine]\nIt's pitiful, I can't believe\nHow every day gets worse for me\nI take a break, I cut you off\nTo keep myself from lookin' soft\nI fill my nights with the way you was\nAnd still wake up with broken dreams\nI make these lies inside my head\nFeel like they're my reality\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]\nNow I'm not holding on, not holding on\nI'm just depressed that you're gone\nNot holding on, not holding on\n\n[Chorus: Adam Levine]\nBeautiful mistakes\nI make inside my head, she's naked in my bed\nAnd now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes\nI wouldn't take 'em back, I'm in love with the past\nAnd now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes\n\n[Verse 3: Megan Thee Stallion]\nYou did me wrong 'cause I let you (Let you)\nUsually, I like my situations beneficial\nDoin' something different, got me lookin' stupid (Damn)\nThe only way I'm comin' back to you is if you're dreaming, lucid (Hmm)\nProve it, if you made a promise then keep it (Keep it)\nWhy you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it (Boy, bye)\nBut really, I was doin' just fine without ya\nLookin' fine, sippin' wine, dancin' on club couches (Ah)\nBaby, why you wanna lose me like you don't need me? (Don't need me)\nLike I don't block you and you still try to reach me (Still try to reach me)\nHow you figure out how to call me from the TV? (Huh?)\nYou're runnin' outta chances and this time I mean it (Ah)\n\n[Bridge: Megan Thee Stallion]\nYeah, bet you miss my love, all in your bed (Bed)\nNow you're stressin' out, pulling your hair (Hair)\nSmelling your pillows and wishin' I was there (I was there)\nSlidin' down the shower wall, lookin' sad (Sad)\nI know it's hard to let go, I'm the best (I'm the best)\nBest you ever had and best you gon' get (Gon' get)\nAnd if we break up, I don't wanna be friends (Be friends)\nYou're toxic\n\n[Chorus: Adam Levine]\nBeautiful mistakes\nI make inside my head, she's naked in my bed\nAnd now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes\nI wouldn't take 'em back, I'm in love with the past\nAnd now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes\n\n[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]\nNah-nah-nah, in my head\nNah-nah-nah, in my bed\nNah-nah-nah, yeah, yeah (Oh)\nMakin' beautiful mistakes\nNah-nah-nah, in my head\nNah-nah-nah, in my bed\nNah-nah-nah, eh\nMakin' beautiful mistakes\n\n[Outro: Adam Levine]\nNah-nah-nah\nNah-nah-nah (Ooh)\nNah-nah-nah\n\n.........\n📷 Wallpaper: https://unsplash.com/\n.........\n📧 Contact / Demo Submissions: contact@7clouds.org\n.........\n💌 Demos / Music Submissions: https://7clouds.edmdistrict.com\n.........\n\n#Maroon5  #BeautifulMistakes #Lyrics #MeganTheeStallion",
